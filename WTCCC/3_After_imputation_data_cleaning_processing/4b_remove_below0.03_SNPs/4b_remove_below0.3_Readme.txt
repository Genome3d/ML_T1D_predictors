In the first phase of the ML logistic model development, the WTCCC T1D imputed dataset was found only to have 85 common SNPs with Denis T1D tissue-specific eQTL table (113 SNPs).
 21 of the missing SNPs were removed by hwe filtering. Nevertheless, by examining some published papers, hwe filtering is not a standard QC for post data imputation for the assumption that the imputation processes procedure accurate genotype data. 
On the other hand, this filtering is required to apply to the pre and post imputation only on the control data only. 
Hwe testing is to detect excessive heterozygous genotype data created by missed calling. 
But the excess heterogeneity could also be the valuable and associated mutation signals. 
The idea is that if this is caused by genotype calling errors, the excessive heterogeneity may not appear in control data. 

Daniel reported that there were 23 SNPs removed by the minor allele frequency, and Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium filtering from the imputed WTCCC T1D dataset. 
Among them, two SNPs were removed by minor allele frequency filtering with values < 0.01. 
Twenty-one SNPs were removed by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (hwe) filtering with p-values < 10-6 . 
Daniel found that hwe filtering was not used after data imputation in many published papers under the assumption that imputation processes produce accurate imputed genotype data. 
On the other hand, excessive hwe filtering could remove potential valuable SNP signals of phenotypes. 
Hence, Justin and William suggested that the post hwe filtering could be removed in the post imputation QC to recover the 21 missing SNPs.

Therefore the imputed WTCCC T1D data was recleaned without hwe filtering to recover the 21 T1D missing SNPs.
